# King-County-Houses-Insights

Formulation and validation of hypothesis about housing market in King County, WA, through exploratory data analysis.

## Business Problem
House Rocket is a digital platform that uses technology to simplify the sale
and purchase of real estate in King County, Washington State.

The company has a simple business model that is basically to buy good houses
in great location at below-market prices and then resell them later at higher
prices to maximize profit and therefore maximize revenue.

The company has a dataset that contains the house sale prices for King County,
which includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. A report with the best
business opportunities should be submitted that considers the following topics:
- Which houses should the company buy and at what price?
- Once the house owned by the company, what is the best time to sell them and 
what would be the sale price?
- Should the company do a renovation to raise the sale price? What would be the 
suggestions for changes? What is the price increase given for each refurbishment
option?

All the context about this project is completely fictitious, including company, CEO 
and business issues.

- The costs of maintaining the business are not considered when calculating the company's profit.
